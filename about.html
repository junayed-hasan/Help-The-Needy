				country. At every level, we collaborate with people around the country to develop and deliver innovative
				solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.<br><br>Our charity
				ratings do not merely repeat what a charity reports about itself using simplistic or automated formulas.
				We dive deep to let you know how efficiently a charity will use your donations to fund the programs you
				want to support. Help The Needy exposes nonprofit abuses and advocates for your interests as a donor.
